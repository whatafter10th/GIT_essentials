to display a list of currently set environment variables in terminal:
printenv

to display the value of any specific environment variable,
echo $[VARIABLE_NAME]
Ex: echo $PATH
echo $JAVA_HOME

a temporary environment variable only lasts until you close the terminal session.
Assign a temporary environment variable with the export command:
export [variable_name]=[variable_value]
export PATH=/Users/test/test_folder:$PATH

to remove an environment variable:
unset [variable_name]

Permanent environment variables are added to the .bash_profile or csh or zsh file:
~/.bash-profile
export [variable_name]=[variable_value]
Execute the new .bash_profile by either restarting the terminal window or using:
source ~/.bash-profile
